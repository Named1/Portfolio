This is my dissertation from university. It is for studying the capabilities of AI learning. The AI uses a simple state machine to switch between states and each stat has a different action. These are only word output to the console of the program. 
When the AI reaches the teaching stat it starts to learn a command, this will be a word inputted by the user, until the AI has learnt it. This is done by storing the word into a textfile that the AI is able to rea from. This then gives the sense that the AI has learned this word as it is able to use it as an output when entering the state later in the programmes running.
